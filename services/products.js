It is mainly utilized in the gold finger protection during the circuit plate (PCB) over wave crease welding, transformer insulation binding, lithium cell polar ear fixing, and other occasions that need heat-resistance. It performs at peak strength over a range of high temperatures without losing its adhesiveness. Polyimide tape won't weaken under high heat, and on top of that can be removed without any leftover residue. It is used in temperatures ranging from -75°C to +260°C. It has been tested and found to work under much more extreme temperatures. It can be used in temperatures as low as -196°C, to as high as 400°C!",
